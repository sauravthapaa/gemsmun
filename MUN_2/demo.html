      <h3>About the economic and social council</h3>
      <p>
        - Economic and Social Council, abbreviated ECOSOC, is one of the United
        Nations' six principal organs established by the UN Charter in 1945 to
        promote international cooperation on economic, social, cultural,
        educational, and health-related issues. It serves as the central forum
        for reflection, debate, and innovative thinking on three dimensions of
        sustainable development-economic, social, and environmental and is also
        in charge of the follow-up to major UN conferences.

                The World Bank Group is one of the worldâ€™s largest sources of
                funding and knowledge for developing countries. Its five
                institutions share a commitment to end extreme poverty by
                reducing the share of the global population that lives in utmost
                poverty to 3 per cent, building shared prosperity by increasing
                the incomes of the poorest 40 percent of people in growing
